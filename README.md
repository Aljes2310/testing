Hi! I'm Alfredo Alvarado.

Currently , I'm learning python

About programming and data processing, I know how to process data in R,  specially oceanographic data 
in several formats(like netcdf, raster, csv). I use R because has many packages that make easy
processing oceanogrpahic data like reshape2, dplyr, cast, netcdf4, and one of the most useful packages for 
data visualization which is ggplot2
